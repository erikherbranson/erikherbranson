## Book club

Looking to start a book club that covers technical topics. If you're interested feel free to message me. Likely topics: `Software quality`, `Testing`, `UI/UX`, `Algorithms`, etc.

## Repos

The repositories on here are open source projects that I work on when I have time. All contributions are welcome even if it's just opening a bug ticket or commenting on an issue.

> Please don't copy my work and try to pass it off as your own to get a job. That's plagiarism and won't work out for you in the end.
